----------------------------------------** PROJECT TODO **------------------------------------------

the program should have seperated board and packman functions..

Board function (a Constructor) should contain following information :
	left_top  : left top corner of the grid..in which the player can play
	right_top : right top corner of the grid..in which the player can play
	left_bottom : left bottom corner of the grid..in which the player can play
	right_bottom : right bottom corner of the grid..in which the player can play

	food : Collection of co-ordinates of points where the food is placed
		   For representation of food...use '.'

	Obstacles : Collection of co-ordinates of points where there is a wall/obstacle
				For representation of wall/obstacle use '-' or '|'

	Empty_Space : the board should keep an empty space for the initial packamn position


Packman function (a Constructor) should contain following information :
	packman : representation of packman (a single Special Character) can use @''
	
	score : score of the player
			initally it will be set to zero
			It can be a getter/setter function

	position : the current position of the packman
			   It will be updated after every move
			   Initially it will be set to a value where the board keeps and empty position

	move : this function moves the packman one co-ordinate above below..left right
		   According to which key has been pressed
		   It will match the new position with board
		   		whether there is a way to move it...
		   		whether there is food available..
		   		whether there is a wall..
		   		etc.
		   	Based on the selection and the comparison
		   	the function will make decision..
		   		whether to move..
		   		Or to stop the game..as the packman hit the wall
	
	end : the end function will end the game and print the final score


//yet to decide where to put this function..can be anywhere..either in board/Packman or a seperate function.. :)
print : a function will print both board as well as packman
